This is an school project made whith my friend Jota. It consist in a perfect (or almost perfect) copy of amazon Web store. 


To install and run i recommend using appserv: https://www.appserv.org/en/

There is a directory called db. There you have mysql databases. One with the structure and the other one whith the products. Yo need to install them.

We learned a lot creating this. At least 300h. It was our TFC (trabajo de fin de ciclo) to pass our superior Studies. Enjoy
